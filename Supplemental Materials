7.1. PARADATA 
Aside from the description of survey research, paradata may play a pivotal role in determining the probability of non-stationarity where metadata indicators are inconsistent or otherwise absent (Rossi, 2015; Sugiyama et al., 2012). Notwithstanding, with respect to any logical language, for example first or third order, and all possible alternative assignments, as illustrated in equations 1.0 through 1.2 (Lipovetsky, 2021), we want to define that a formula compared to another formula, see equation 1.0, to be true Pr(ϕ); (Koller, 2007; Van den Broeck et al., 2021). Consequently, we must determine, as described by Van den Broeck (2021; 2011), what is the probability that ϕ is true in the event ψ is also true:  Pr(ϕ|ψ); (Van den Broeck et al., 2021). 

16.2. 	SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL:  There are myriad circumstances when considering areas of further research. From those emerging and most prominent areas involve Natural Language Processing (NLP) modeling and the associated unique stylometry of corpus inputs (Fridman et al., 2016).
